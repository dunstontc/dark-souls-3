Beckon	Talk to Yoel of Londor not far from the Foot of the High Wall bonfire and  take him into your service. Talk to him again at Firelink Shrine to get the  gesture.
Call Over	Received after you trade a Homeward Bone (or any other "Pickle pee" item)  for the first time with Pickle Pee, Pump-a-Rum Crow.  This is the only  gesture that has an associated sound, which is dependant on the gender and  voice of the user.
Welcome	Talk to the Cornyx in the Undead Settlement, and accept his services. Talk  to him at Firelink Shrine twice to get the gesture.
Applause	Talk to Leonhard once he appears in Firelink Shrine. He will be leaning  against Younger Prince Lothric's throne. He will give you five Cracked Red  Eye Orbs, and leave. Talk to him again after you've obtained a Pale Tongue,  and he will give you a key to a locked door beneath the Tower on the Wall  bonfire in the High Wall of Lothric that leads to an imprisoned Darkwraith.  Kill the Darkwraith to receive the full Red Eye Orb, then talk to Leonhard  again to receive the gesture.

Bow	Automatically received
Proper Bow	Received when summoning Yellowfinger Heysel in Farron Keep.  Steps:     1. Go to Rosaria's Bed Chamber and offer a Pale Tongue to the Rosaria's     Fingers covenant.    2. Yellowfinger Heysel's summon sign will appear next to the tower full     of slugs near the Keep Ruins bonfire.  Notes:     - Abyss Watchers must still be alive.    - Giving a Pale Tongue to Rosaria, Mother of Rebirth will cause Sirris     of the Sunless Realms questline to fail and you will not be able to     receive the Silvercat Ring, Sunset Armor Set, Sunset Shield, Sunless     Talisman, Dragonslayer's Axe, and the Mirrah Chain Set until the next     game cycle. She can be killed in Firelink to receive the Sunless Set and     Talisman from the  Shrine Handmaiden if her  quest has failed.  As such it     is one of the more rarely seen Gestures, with many players waiting until     NG+ to obtain it.    - There is a cap of 99 Pale Tongues you can offer. If you reach this     limit, you can't offer more, and, consequently, you can't gain this Gesture     anymore. Pale Tongues used for respec don't count on the 99 limit.
Dignified Bow	Received from meeting Yuria of Londor.
Duel Bow	Received upon summoning the Londor Pale Shade that appears in various  locations when you have five Dark Sigils (by leveling up with Yoel). These  locations are: The Farron Keep Perimeter before the Abyss Watchers fight  and outside the boss chamber for Pontiff Sulyvahn (extra requirements must  be met for the summon to appear here). Note that while Pale Shade can be  summoned for the Soul of Cinder fight, it will not perform the gesture.
Legion Etiquette	Pray to the Old Wolf of Farron in the Farron Swamp.
Darkmoon Loyalty	Received from speaking with Sirris in Firelink Shrine after giving Dreamchaser's  Ashes to the Shirine Handmaid.

Prostration	Recieved from Patches after replying "No" when he asks for forgiveness in  Firelink Shrine, or after confronting him in the Cathedral of the Deep  after he lowers the bridge with "You know who I am".
Toast	Recieved by talking to Siegward of Catarina after assisting him in  defeating the Demon on the way to the Road of Sacrifices. Can similarly be  received in the kitchen near the Distant Manor in Irithyll of the Boreal  Valley if previously missed.
